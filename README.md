Introduction to quantum information processing
COM-309 / 5 credits

Teacher: Macris Nicolas

Language: English

Summary

Information is processed in physical devices. In the quantum regime the concept of classical bit is replaced by the quantum bit. We introduce quantum principles, and then quantum communications, key distribution, quantum entropy, and spin dynamics. No prior knowledge of quantum physics is required.
